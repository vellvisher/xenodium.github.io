why?

Had conflicting/forgotten configuration while setting color theme.


1. reset preferences
gconftool --recursive-unset /apps/gnome-terminal

2. Set .bash_profile
export TERM="screen-256color"

3. Ensure .bash_profile is always read
gnoe-terminal->Edit->Profiles...->Edit->Title and Command->X Run command as login shell

4. Bonus if you want solarized on your terminal:
